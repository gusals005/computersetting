### How to set this repository?

- You can set 'yourpath' in the vimrc file(usually, ~/.vim or /usr/share/vim/vimXX).         
I wrote the path in the first line.          

```
mv vimrc ~/.vimrc    
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git /yourpath/vim/bundle/Vundle.vim       
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim/master/colors/jellybeans.vim > /yourpath/vim/colors/jellybeans.vim          
rm -rf ./computersetting              
```
